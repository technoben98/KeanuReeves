            <p class="main-info">
                Keanu Reeves is one of the best movie actors to come out of Hollywood, and his handsome looks and sweet 
                personality have enchanted millions of fans. He has had a turbulent life, but has held his head high 
                and continues undefeated. Reeves and his mother were abandoned when he was just three years old. 
                He also had to care for his sister as she battled leukemia. 
                However, he has not allowed his difficult circumstances to be an excuse for failure. 
                He was born in Beirut, Lebanon on September 2, 1964. </p>
            <p class="main-info">
                He grew up in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he fell in love with hockey. He played the goalkeeper position and hoped to become a professional hockey player. However, he dedicated his future to acting when he turned 15. At 20, he started working as a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (C.B.C.). He also featured in stage plays and, notably, a Coca-cola advert. He got interested in music and helped form Dogstar, a rock band, in 1991.</p>
            
                <p class="main-info">
                In 1989, he was featured in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure,” and the movie did relatively well.
Reeves got married to Jennifer Syme in 1998, but she died in 2001. After a few difficult years, he rose again with “The Devil’s Advocate” in 1997 and delivered a stellar performance. In 1999, he got to play the lead role in “The Matrix,” a uber-successful franchise that has grossed more than three billion dollars. In 2014, he started playing the legendary assassin in the “John Wick” franchise, which has grossed more than half a billion dollars.
